You see an old man standing in front of the cave. He looks troubled. As he sees you approaching, his face lightens up. He says:  "Greetings, brave adventurer! The fair land of Ellesmere is haunted by evil spirits! The only thing that can save us now is the Golden McGuffin of King Lazyplot. Alas, it was buried in this cave centuries ago. Will you retrieve it for us?  If you do, beware: Foul orcs have made this cave their home."
The troubled sage says: "You know, "no" is not really an option here."
The troubled sage says: "Alright, alright. For your troubles, I'm willing to pay you 30 golden maple leaves."
The troubled sage says: "Yes, the small ones. One tenth of an ounce each."
The troubled sage says: "No, I don't have any larger ones, sorry."
The troubled sage says: "you drive a hard bargain, you sure do. Alright, i'll give you 50, but that's really all I have."
The troubled sage says: "Fine, here's 25 gold coins up front. Now will you help us, please?"
The troubled sage says: "Look, I don't have the rest with me. I have to make a withdrawal first."
The troubled sage says: "Bilbo-friggin-Baggins! Will you go into the cave already?"
The troubled sage says: "You DO understand me, do you?"
The troubled sage says: "Not quite the brightest candle, aren't we?"
The troubled sage says: "You there, big boy, you go cave, find the golden thing, bring it here, ok?"
The troubled sage says: "You're really starting to annoy me."
The troubled sage says: "I'm starting to wish my developer had already implemented the method to fighting static npcs. At least then this would be over soon."
The troubled sage says: "You know, I was supposed to be a chatbot, jumping between nodes and whatnot.  But no, I suppose creating pathfinding algorithms for orcs and detecting wall collisions was waaaaay more important. Now look at me, just reading hard coded messages like a hello world program."
The troubled sage says: "Look, do what you want, but I'm just gonna give you the silent treatment now."
The troubled sage says: "..."

The troubled sage says: "Do that one more time and I crash, it dare you!"

The troubled sage says: "Oh, thank you, brave adventurer! You saved us all. May fortune smile upon you. here, take this humble reward as a token of our gratitude!"
The troubled sage says: "How wonderful, you found the Golden McGuffin! here, take your reward, as promised."
The troubled sage says: "It's good to know that there are still reliable adventurers out there. now let me hold up my end of the bargain."
The troubled sage says: "It's good to know that there are still reliable adventurers out there. now let me hold up my end of the bargain."
The troubled sage says: "Well, I suppose this turned out better than I feared. Thank you for your efforts, please take this payment and be on your way."
The troubled sage says: "Oh, wow, look who returned! Captain Dimwit! I suppose you want your money now, do you? Fine, take it.  Now, please, for the love of he who created all the zeros and ones, sod off, will you?"
